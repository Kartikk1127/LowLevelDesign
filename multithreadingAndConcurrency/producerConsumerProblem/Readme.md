# Producer and Consumer Problem
This is also known as **Bounded Buffer Problem**

It is a synchronization construct that allows threads to have:
1. Mutual exclusion (only one thread in the critical section at a time)
2. Wait-notify coordination between threads.
3. Each thread can wait and notify the other thread when it has completed processing.
