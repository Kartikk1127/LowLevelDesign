# LowLevelDesign
LLD is where your code starts to take shape. It's the bridge between the architecture and actual implementation.

## Key Characteristics
1. Code should be granular.
2. It is implementation focussed.
3. Applies the OOPs principles.

## Why is LLD important?
1. Avoids rework.
2. Improves collaboration.
3. Promotes scalability.
4. Encourages best practices.

## Principles of Software Design

### DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)
Each piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation within the system.

**Importance**
1. Reduces redundancy.
2. Easier maintenance.
3. Single point of change.

**When not to use DRY?**
1. Premature abstraction.
2. Performance critical code.
3. Sacrificing readability.
4. Legacy code.


### KISS(Keep it simple, stupid)
A design should be kept as simple as possible. Complexity should only be introduced when absolutely necessary.

**Importance**
1. Easier debugging.
2. Improved readability.
3. Better maintainability.
4. Faster development.

### YAGNI(You aren't gonna need it)
Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you might need them.

**Importance**
1. Reduced waste.
2. Simplified codebase.
3. Faster development.

**When not to follow?**
1. Well known requirements.
2. Performance critical areas.
