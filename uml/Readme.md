# Unified Modeling Language
This is a standardized visual language used to model and document the designs of software systems.  
It offers a set of diagrams to represent different aspects of a system, getting a clear communication among stakeholders and helping us to understand the design.  

## How many official UML diagrams are there?
There are 14 types of UML diagrams:
1. **Structural Diagrams** :
   1. Class Diagram -- Shows classes, interfaces, relationships
   2. Object Diagram -- Snapshot of objects at a specific point of time.
   3. Component Diagram -- Describes software components and their dependencies.
   4. Composite Structure Diagram -- Shows internal structure of a class and collaborations.
   5. Deployment Diagram -- Describes physical deployment of artifacts.
   6. Package Diagram -- Organizes elements into packages/modules.
   7. Profile Diagram -- Used to define custom stereotypes, useful for modeling extensions. Profile, stereotypes, tagged values, constraints.

2. **Behavioural Diagrams** :
   1. Use case Diagram -- Shows system functionality from the user's point of view.
   2. Activity Diagram -- Flowchart of operations (like processes or workflow).
   3. Sequence Diagram -- Shows interaction of objects in a time sequence.
   4. Communication Diagram -- Like sequence diagram, but emphasizes object relationships.
   5. State Machine Diagram -- Shows different states of an object and how it transitions.
   6. Interaction overview Diagram -- High level overview of diagrams.
   7. Timing Diagram -- Focuses on object behaviour with respect to time.
