A group of multiple factories wrapped inside a single interface.

## What is it?
It is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Pros
1. Consistency
2. Decouples client from concrete implementation
3. Promotes OCP
4. Scalable and Flexible
5. Centralized object creation logic.

## Cons
1. Increased complexity.
2. Over-engineering.
3. Addition of more code.
