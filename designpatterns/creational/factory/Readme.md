# Factory Pattern

## What is it?
It is a creational design pattern that lets you create objects without telling your code exactly which class to use.

## Why use it?
1. When the client does not know what exact class of the object it needs.
2. To decouple object creation logic from client code.
3. When object creation is complex or depends on some conditions. 

## Real life Analogy
Ask factory to create laptops for me.  
Notification Service  
Payment Gateway  

## Pros
1. Promotes loose coupling.
2. Enhances extensibility(OCP)
3. Centralises Object Creation(SRP)
4. Increases flexibility
5. Improves code reusability.

## Cons
1. Increased complexity.
2. More code overhead
